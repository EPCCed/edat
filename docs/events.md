# Firing events
Events are _fired_ from a source to target process. Firing of events can occur at any point in the users code (e.g. in the main function and/or executing tasks) and is non-blocking, so the user's code will continue to execute as soon as the call has been made. Events serve two purposes, first as a dependency of tasks (contributing to the execution of the task) and secondly providing the ability to send some data to this task if required. If the programmer chooses to associate some payload data with an event, this data is copied by EDAT when the call to fire an event is made. Hence events are truely _fire and forget_, the immediate return of the call to fire an event provides no suggestion of when the event is actually communicated or the consuming task executed, but the programmer can immediately reuse any payload data buffer provided to the event as a separate copy has been made. Once an event is fired it is not possible to delete that event.

# Firing an event
The API call to fire an event is `int edatFireEvent(void* data, int data_type, int number_elements, int target_rank, const char * event_identifier)`, as mentioned above this call is non-blocking (returns immediately) and explicitly copies any provided data into a separate buffer space. In addition to an explicit integer target rank (e.g. 0 to process zero, 1 to process one etc) the user can also provide __EDAT_SELF__ to send the event to itself and __EDAT_ALL__ to send the event to all process (effectively you can think of this as a broadcast, broadcasting the event to all processes including itself.)
