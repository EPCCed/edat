Name:      wtime

Purpose:   returns wall clock time with a fixed reference point.

Arguments: None

Returns:   The wall clock time in seconds as a double is returned. 

Notes:     This function uses two structures defined in the UNIX
           system call, gettimeofday(2). The structure, "timeval" 
           is defined in the include file <sys/time.h> as:

                 struct timeval {
                     long tv_sec;
                     long tv_usec;
                 }

           where timeval.tv_sec is the seconds and timeval.tv_usec
           is the microseconds.  
 
History:   Written by Tim Mattson, Dec 1, 1988
           Modified by Rob van der Wijngaart, May 2006, to change
           default clock to the Unix system clock.
